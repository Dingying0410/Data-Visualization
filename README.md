lab2     
Task 1 
1.1)  Compute the total number of wins for each of the teams in MLB over 2010-2015, display them in a descending sorted order. 
1.2)  Compute the average payroll per year for all teams over 2010-2015, displaying them in a descending sorted order 
1.3)  Create a visualization of your choice which will all allow you to show whether a team’s winning record is related to its payroll. 

Task 2 

2.1)  Compute the Batting Averages  for each of the MLB teams over 2010-2015, display them in a descending sorted order. The Batting Average is defined as Hits/At Bats. The average is calculated from all players in each team. 
2.2) Create a visualization of your choice which will allow you to decide whether a team’s batting average is related to its win-loss record. 

Task 3 

3.1) Display the average ERA (Earned Run Average) for each of the MLB teams in 2010-2015, in a descending sorted order. A lower ERA indicates a better pitching performance. 
3.2) Create a visualization of your choice which will allow you to decide if a team’s win-loss record is related to its pitching performance. 

For each of the three tasks, 1.3, 2.2, 3.2, please provide a short analysis (related or not, etc.) based on the visualizations. Include your answers in the notebook.

Using visualization to show the following trend: For the top 5 teams that have the most total wins between 2010 and 2015: 

4.1) How are their Batting Averages changed from 2010-2015
4.2) How are their Wins/Losses changed from 2010-2015 
4.3) How are their average ERAs changed from 2010-2015
